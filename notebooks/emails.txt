You definitely have to have patience to deal with all the "stuff" around 
here.  It's a good thing I've mellowed. Plus, it's my job.  

Michael is a doll!  I don't think it's supposed to rain on Saturday, but that 
could change at any moment.  The Women's Center needs all kinds of things.  I 
have a friend that works for the United Way and goes over there quite often.  
If you have clothes, they want you to take them to their Resale shop but they 
also need linens, just everything really.  I usually give my things to 
Kristine's church just because I always forget to put them in the truck and 
bring up here.  

I've got next Thursday and Friday on my calendar.  I hope you guys have a 
great time.  21, I remember that, wild child that I was!  Any of the camera 
places should be able to do that enlargement.  I know Wolfe Camera over at 
Allen Center does that type of thing.  I don't know how long it will take to 
get it back.  What exactly do you want to get done, and I'll call and 
inquire.  I'll need the size you want it mounted to also.

This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it.

We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how 
everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks 
this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come 
home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, 
and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take 
Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend 
with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE 
the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is 
great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll 
call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.

I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is 
Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can 
enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?

I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.

I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just 
in case you are sending anyone else's today.

Thanks,

Kay

Thanks for the info.

What I am really wondering, though, is: is Enron ISO 9000 certified?

Justin,  ISO 9000 is a a type of standard which companies can seek to bring 
their corporations in line with and supposedly its a good thing to have. I 
attached an article from a website from which you can buy the standards. If 
you need more info let me know. see ya later y'all Ian      ISO9.com and ANSI 
Establish Reselling Agreement for the ISO 9000:2000 Standards  New York, NY 
and Oakland, CA, December 11, 2000 - ISO9.com and the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) have announced an agreement regarding U.S. 
distribution of the ISO 9000 series of quality management system standards, 
including the soon to be published ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 standards. 
ISO9.com sells electronic versions of the Standards on the Internet at 
http://store.iso9.com << File: http://store.iso9.com/ >> . The new version of 
ISO 9000 will be available on December 15.  "Distribution of the ISO 9000 
standards is an important step for our organization," said Glenn Kohner, 
Founder and CTO of ISO9.com. "Customers on the Internet expect instant 
delivery of information. Users on our site are learning about Internet ISO 
9000. It's only natural that they would want access to the actual Standards." 
 There are two ways to procure the ISO 9000 standards from ISO9.com. The 
Standards, which a company is required to own to be in compliance, will be 
offered both independently and bundled with the ISO9.com application. With 
the integrated version, companies will be able to view the Standard alongside 
their QMS, in a seamless format.   "ISO9.com is one of ANSI's more unique 
value added resellers in that it has actually integrated the ISO 9001:2000 
standard into its application," commented Bob Feghali, ANSI vice president of 
business development and chief information officer. "We are committed to fast 
action in the delivery of the new ISO 9000 revisions; partnering with 
ISO9.com will greatly assist ANSI in our ability to insure a widespread 
distribution of the complete ISO 9000 family of standards."  Sergio Mazza, 
past President of ANSI, Appointed to Board of Directors  Oakland, CA. 
November 21, 2000 - ISO9.com, the world's first Application Service Provider 
to the ISO marketplace, announced the addition of Sergio Mazza to the

administrator and coordinator of private sector voluntary standardization 
systems in the United States for more than 80 years. As a member of the Board 
of Directors, Mr. Mazza will bring his depth of experience and knowledge in 
both international standards and high technology to help the Company achieve 
its corporate vision.  "We are truly excited to have Sergio Mazza join our 
team," said Fred Hornbacher, CEO of ISO9.com. "He has tremendous depth of 
experience in our highly specialized field, and is uniquely qualified to help 
us bring our online vision for the quality and standards industries to 
fruition."  Mr. Mazza's 21 years of proven leadership experience with high 
technology service businesses and his six years as the president of ANSI will 
both be instrumental in his new role with ISO9.com. His corporate career and 
leadership experience ranges from his activity as a software entrepreneur to 
his service as president of Memorex North America and Memorex Computer 
Supplies Worldwide. Mr. Mazza has recently been working as an advisor to 
online companies. He has extensive international experience, is fluent in 
four languages, and holds a BS degree in economics from the University of

Allyson,

What is the proceedure for objecting to a request (either the intervenor's or 
the Public Staff's)?  Is our position weakened in resisting an intervenor's 
request if we have given the same information to the Public Staff?

Thanks again,

Kay

Subject: RE: CPCN proceeding - AG intervention

I thought you might ask me that!  NCNG could make the request, but we would
have a good argument that it doesnt have the same need to know as the Public
Staff and Attorney General (which both represent "the Public") and that the
potential for misuse of proprietary information is much greater and harder
to circumscribe.  I tend to think NCNG would not ask.  Based on the limited
statement of interest in their petition to intervene, it's hard for me to
see what they could justify asking for.  Also, they always have to be
careful, because more often than not, they are going to be on the receiving
end of data requests.  They can't argue that they're entitled to obtain
certain information if they ever want to argue that they don't have to
disclose the same thing.

The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I
think
misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement.

Hi Allyson,

What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has
intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office
(or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the
confidential information we file?

Thanks,

Kay
